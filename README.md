# System-Dynamics-Pattern-Recognizer

System Dynamics (SD) is a methodology, in which principles of feedback control engineering are used to understand the dynamics of socio-economic systems and to design new policies. Managerial, economic, environmental and biological systems are the major application areas. A System Dynamics simulation model is a set of nonlinear, coupled, first-order differential equations. 

SD researchers and practitioners use some common terms to describe the behaviors of the variables they are interested in. For example, behavior patterns of Y1, Y2 and Y3 below are typically called "S-Shaped Decline", "Decline-And-Growth", and "Negative Exponential Growth", respectively.

As a result of the complexity of the underlying structure, such behaviours can be highly distorted and noisy.

### SDPR

System Dynamics Pattern Recognizer (SDPR) takes a time-series generated by simulation and classifies it into one of the **25 predefined patterns**, or as "none of the patterns" case.

SDPR is currently hosted on [this Gitlab repository] (https://gitlab.com/k2arya/system-dynamics-pattern-recognizer).
