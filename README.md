# System-Dynamics-Pattern-Recognizer

System Dynamics (SD) is a methodology, in which principles of feedback control engineering are used to understand the dynamics of socio-economic systems and to design new policies. Managerial, economic, environmental and biological systems are the major application areas. A System Dynamics simulation model is a set of nonlinear, coupled, first-order differential equations. 

System Dynamics Pattern Recognizer (SDPR) takes a time-series generated by simulation and classifies it into one of the **25 predefined patterns**, or as "none of the patterns" case.

SDPR is currently hosted on [this Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/k2arya/system-dynamics-pattern-recognizer).
